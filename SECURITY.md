# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
The latest `main` branch is actively supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please do not open public issues for suspected vulnerabilities.
Instead, email maintainers with:
- impact summary
- reproduction steps
- affected versions

We aim to acknowledge reports within 72 hours and provide remediation guidance quickly.

## Secrets and API keys
- Never commit API keys or credentials.
- Use environment variables for provider secrets (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`).
